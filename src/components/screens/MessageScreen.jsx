            My love, celebrating these 10 months of long distance feels like a sacred victory. Every kilometer that separates us only amplifies the depth of my love and respect for you. You are my greatest blessing, the answer to every silent prayer.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg font-light leading-relaxed">
            I promise you this, my queen: I will dedicate every breath to cherishing you, protecting you, and building a life of peace and endless joy by your side. Our long distance will soon be a beautiful memory, because I promise to marry you. That is my absolute truth.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg font-light leading-relaxed">
            I send you all my blessings and infinite positive energy. Know that I am always with you, in every thought and every prayer. My love is a shield against all worries.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-light leading-relaxed">
            More, more love, always with the highest respect.
